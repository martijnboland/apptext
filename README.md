# AppText
AppText is a Content Management System for Applications.

## Why?
Many custom software applications (web, mobile, native) are shipped with embedded content. Think of labels, tooltips or even complete pages with information. This content often needs to be localized in multiple languages.

Once an application is released, updating the embedded content can become a bit of burden. Even the smallest textual change often requires a new version that needs to be deployed by the developer of the application. The same when adding a new language or adding missing translations.

The primary goal of AppText is to enable content updates in applications without having to go through the entire process of deploying a new version of the application.
